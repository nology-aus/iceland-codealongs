    // What is inheritance?
    // Why do we need inheritance?

    // Topics
    // What do parents and children refer to in the context of inheritance?
    // How can we extend functionality of a class? Using the extends keyword
    // What does the super keyword mean? Allows us to call the constructor of the inherited class
    // When can we get away without using the super keyword? When the parent has a default constructor
    // Can a child class access properties of it's parent? How? You can just use them like normal properties
    // Can we inherit from multiple classes? why/why not? In Java is no. But you can do it in other languages
    // The way to get around this in Java is using interfaces. You can implement multiple interfaces
    // How can we override a method? why would we? You can write a method with the same name

    // What is an interface?
    // An interface is a set of functionality that can be inherited
    // interfaces don't exist until they are implemented
    // interfaces define which functions the implementing class must have
    // classes and interfaces are different things!

        //    Cool inheritance challenge
        // -  Create a parent class called person, they have a property called name that is set in their constructor
        // -  person has a method called say your name
        // -  Create a child class called student that inherits from person
        // -  Create a child class called teacher that inherits from person
        // -  students have a property called cohort, which is a string
        // -  When a student says their name, they should also mention which cohort they are in
        // -  Teachers have a method called call meeting, which takes a person and prints both the teacher and the persons name to the console

        // -  create a teacher called Aidan and a teacher called Calum
        // -  create 3 students
        // -  Put all 5 in an array and make them say their name
        // -  Make Calum and Aidan have a meeting
        // -  Make both teachers have a meeting with a student each
